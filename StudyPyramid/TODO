1. When exception raised from codes, the error log will not be output into the logfile specified in production.ini file(say server.log), but it's logged in uwsgi's logging file(say uwsgi.log).

Try context=Exception and define the custom view to invoking log.error to make sure the error log will go to server.log rather than uwsgi.log.
